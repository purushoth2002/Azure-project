## Project Overview
Integrated Text Summarization and Image Captioning is a comprehensive solution that combines the power of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Computer Vision. Our project aims to provide a platform where users can upload text and images to receive concise summaries and descriptive captions respectively.

## Team Members
- *N. Purushothaman* - Backend Development
- *R. Subitha* - Frontend Development
- *J. Anjumol* - Cloud Service Integration
- *B. Thiruvenkadam* - Documentation and Voice Over

## Features
- *Text Summarization*: Provides a concise summary of the input text.
- *Image Captioning*: Generates a descriptive caption for the uploaded image.
- *User-friendly Interface*: Simple and intuitive UI for ease of use.
- *Cloud Integration*: Seamless cloud service integration for scalability and performance.

## Technologies Used
- *Backend*: Python, Flask/Django, NLP Libraries (like NLTK, spaCy, or Transformers)
- *Frontend*: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React/Vue.js
- *Cloud Services*: AWS/GCP/Azure for hosting and storage
- *Database*: MySQL/PostgreSQL/NoSQL
- *Version Control*: Git, GitHub/GitLab

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
    
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    bash
    cd your-repo
    
3. Install dependencies:
    bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    
4. Set up the database:
    bash
    python manage.py migrate
    
5. Run the development server:
    bash
    python manage.py runserver
    
## Usage
1. Open your web browser and go to http://localhost:8000.
2. Upload a text file for summarization or an image for captioning.
3. Click on the respective buttons to get the summary or caption.
4. View and download the results.

## Architecture
- *Backend*: Handles the logic for text summarization and image captioning using pre-trained models.
- *Frontend*: Provides the interface for user interaction and displays the results.
- *Cloud Services*: Manages the hosting, storage, and scaling of the application.
- *Database*: Stores user data and results for future reference.
